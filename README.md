# Task-7
Firefox Extension Audit & Browser Performance Optimization

📌 Objective
The goal of this task was to review all installed Firefox browser extensions, remove unnecessary or suspicious ones, and evaluate the impact on browser performance and privacy.

✅ Step-by-Step Work Performed
1. 🔓 Open the Browser’s Extension/Add-ons Manager
Launched Firefox.
Opened the Add-ons Manager using:
The keyboard shortcut Ctrl + Shift + A, or
The Firefox menu (≡) → Add-ons and Themes.
Navigated to the Extensions section to view all installed browser extensions.

2. 🔍 Review All Installed Extensions Carefully
At the time of the audit, the following extensions were installed:
Extension Name	Purpose
Wappalyzer	- Detects technologies used on websites
Netcraft Extension	- Anti-phishing and site safety check
ClearURLs -	Removes tracking parameters from URLs
Video DownloadHelper	- Downloads videos/media from websites
Audio Equalizer -	Adjusts audio output in-browser
Tab Session Manager	- Saves and restores tab sessions

4. 🔐 Check Permissions and Reviews for Each Extension
For each extension, I:
Opened the Manage view.
Reviewed the permissions it requested (e.g., access to all websites, tab history, clipboard, etc.).
Checked the developer, number of users, and user reviews on addons.mozilla.org.
🛡️ This step helped determine whether the extension was trustworthy and if it posed any privacy risks.

4. 🚩 Identify Unused or Suspicious Extensions
Extensions flagged for removal based on limited usage or potential performance/privacy concerns:
Extension Name	                                    |                       Reason for Removal
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ClearURLs	                                          |                       Redundant in my workflow
Video DownloadHelper	                              |                       No longer needed for regular browsing tasks
Audio Equalizer	                                    |                       Rarely used; offered little performance value
Tab Session Manager	                                |                       Replaced by Firefox's native session restore

6. 🧹 Remove Suspicious or Unnecessary Extensions
Removed the 4 flagged extensions directly from the Add-ons Manager using:
⋯ (three-dot menu) → Remove
Remaining extensions:
✅ Wappalyzer
✅ Netcraft
These were kept because they are trusted, actively maintained, and essential to my workflow.

6. 🔁 Restart Browser and Check for Performance Improvements
Fully closed and reopened Firefox to apply the changes.
Used:
about:performance
Firefox Task Manager (Shift + Esc)
Assessed the impact of extension removal on:
CPU usage
Memory usage
Energy impact
Startup time
Tab responsiveness

⚡️ Result: Noticeable performance improvement. Firefox became faster to launch, tabs loaded quicker, and memory/CPU usage dropped significantly during active browsing.

📈 Outcome & Benefits
Removed 4 non-essential extensions.
Improved browser speed, system responsiveness, and resource efficiency.
Reduced privacy and security risks by eliminating unused extensions with broad permissions.

🔐 Why This Task Matters
Regularly auditing browser extensions helps to:
🛡️ Enhance security by minimizing the attack surface.
🔒 Improve privacy by limiting data access.
🚀 Boost performance by reducing unnecessary background processes.
